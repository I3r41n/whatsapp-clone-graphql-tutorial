# whatsapp-clone-graphql-tutorial

This is my attempt on this [graphql tutorial](https://medium.com/the-guild/whatsapp-clone-using-react-hooks-suspense-graphql-apollo-typescript-and-postgresql-de1840c27d21)

With little changes to the code (for now) and no tests (it's a spike ...)

To run:
* Server
1. yarn on the **whatsapp-clone-server** folder 
2. yarn start :)

* Client 
1. yarn on the **whatsapp-clone-client** folder 
2. yarn codegen 
3. yarn start

You may use the existent users (check whatsapp-clone-server/db.ts) or try signing up
(for now its not being persisted)
